# Technical Writing Portfolio â€“ Jesse Sierke

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I'm a professional writer with a background in multimodal and digital communication, and I'm passionate about making complex information clear, accessible, and user-friendly.

This repo contains samples of my technical writing work, including how-to guides, API documentation, troubleshooting articles, and visual aids. All materials are for fictional products and companies created to showcase my range.
