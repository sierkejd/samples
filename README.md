# Technical Writing Portfolio ‚Äì Jesse Sierke

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I'm a professional writer with a background in multimodal and digital communication, and I'm passionate about making complex information clear, accessible, and user-friendly.

This repo contains samples of my technical writing work, including how-to guides, API documentation, troubleshooting articles, and visual aids. All materials are for fictional products and companies created to showcase my range.

## üìÑ Writing Samples

### üõ≥Ô∏è MarineNav 4500 Quick Start Guide (Reconstructed from USS Kennedy, 1998)

This guide is a modern reconstruction of documentation I created as a Quartermaster (navigation specialist) aboard the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67). The OEM manual for our electronic navigation system was over 300 pages long and poorly suited for fast-paced bridge operations. I wrote an unofficial ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù for watchstanders that distilled essential functions into a single, user-friendly reference.

This version showcases my ability to:
- Translate complex system documentation into task-focused guidance
- Prioritize user needs in high-stakes operational environments
- Present clear, modular steps for fast comprehension and execution
