# Setting Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in CloudLock360

Welcome to CloudLock360! To help keep your account secure, we require all users to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA provides an extra layer of protection beyond just your password by requiring a verification code from your mobile device.

This guide walks you through the steps to enable MFA for your CloudLock360 account.
